Intro to Facebook Data Access This article provides an introduction to Facebook data downloading, the user authorizations required to download data, how NetBase stores Facebook data, and an overview of the steps for downloading data for access by your NetBase company account. Facebook Data Available for Downloading NetBase downloads data matching Facebook channels. You can specify the channels from which you want to download data in one of two ways: • Add channels to the Channel Manager • Add channels to a topic in your NetBase company account Assuming that your account has sufficient Facebook-Only authorizations for the number of Facebook channels you are tracking, NetBase downloads posts, comments, and metrics from your owned channels and non-owned public channels. How NetBase Stores Facebook Data NetBase stores Facebook data that you download from channels in your single-client data pool, which is only accessible by users in your company account. Once downloaded, all topics in your company account can match against the Facebook data through keywords, channels, and image content. For details on the maximum history, data available for analysis, and other information, see How Topics Match Facebook Data. Authorizations are Required to Download Facebook Data NetBase provides the broadest Facebook coverage in the industry. For 100% compliance with Facebook's data policies, NetBase must collect authorizations from users in your company account to download data. Facebook requires authorization from end users as industry-standard practice for providing all social media analytics vendors, including NetBase, temporary and secure access to public data. Facebook imposes a rate https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/1Intro_to_Facebook_Data_Acc… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:29:55 GMT Powered by 1 limit—a maximum number of hourly requests per authorized user that NetBase can submit to retrieve data through the Facebook API. The availability, latency (the period between an author posting and the post being available in your company account), and coverage of Facebook data flowing into your single-client data pool depends on maintaining a sufficient number of authorized users across your company account for coverage on all channels you are tracking. If your company account has insufficient authorizations, Facebook data streaming into your single-client data pool will have a longer latency and you will eventually miss posts. If your company account is tracking both Instagram and Facebook channels, NetBase recommends that your analysts contribute Facebook-Only user authorizations to keep Facebook data flowing into your account at an optimal rate. For instructions on calculating the number of authorizations your company account needs and inviting users to authorize, see Managing Facebook Authorizations for Your Company Account. High-Level Steps for Downloading Facebook Channel Data Follow these high-level steps to download Facebook channel data into your NetBase single-client data pool: 1. In the Channel Manager, ensure that all Facebook channels you want to track are listed and note the total number your NetBase account is downloading. To add channels, you can either add them to topics (they automatically appear in the Channel Manager) or upload a list of channels via a CSV file in the Channel Manager. 2. In the Authorization Manager, ensure that your NetBase company account has at least 1 Facebook-Only authorization for every 200 Facebook channels you are tracking. See Managing Facebook-Only Authorizations for Your Company Account for details. If you have sufficient authorizations, NetBase downloads data from channels in the Channel Manager into your NetBase company account's single-client data pool where it is available for matching by all of your company's topics and NetBase Pro searches. For information on Facebook post metadata, engagement metrics, see How Topics Match Facebook Data. 3. To retrieve all data from a particular channel for analysis, you must add the channel to the Facebook Channels filter on a topic's Definition tab. If you do not do this, the topic only collects channel posts that match the topic's keywords and image content. For detailed instructions, see Defining Channel-Based Topics. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/1Intro_to_Facebook_Data_Acc… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:29:55 GMT Powered by 2 https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/1Intro_to_Facebook_Data_Acc… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:29:55 GMT Powered by 3

Authorizing for Facebook This article provides steps for contributing a Facebook-Only authorization to keep Facebook data flowing into your NetBase company account with optimal latency. NetBase recommends that you read Introduction to Facebook Data Downloading before following the steps on this page. Understanding Authorization Types The steps below explain how to contribute a Facebook-Only authorization. If you have already authorized for Instagram, you have contributed an "Instagram via Facebook" authorization that NetBase uses primarily for downloading Instagram data and secondarily for downloading Facebook data. If your NetBase company account is tracking both Instagram along with more than 100 Facebook channels, we recommend that you maintain a sufficient number of both Instagram via Facebook and Facebook-Only authorizations, which NetBase uses exclusively for downloading Facebook channel data. Before You Start To contribute a Facebook-Only authorization, you need login credentials to any Facebook profile. Note the following: • Do not authorize using a Facebook profile that has already been used for authorization by a user in your NetBase account. Authorizing through a Facebook profile that another user has already used does not increase your company account's capacity for downloading data. To view the Facebook profiles already used for authorization, export data from the Authorization Manager. • The Facebook profile is not required to contain a Facebook fan page; however, if you authorize through a profile with at least one fan page, you are not required to reauthorize every 60 days. Authorizing for Facebook in NetBase Follow the steps below to contribute a Facebook-Only authorization from within the NetBase application. If you have already provided an Instagram via Facebook authorization in NetBase, follow the instructions in Authorizing for Facebook via Email. Click your user name at the top right of the screen and select Social Authorization. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/2Authorizing_for_Facebook Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:31:08 GMT Powered by 1 In the Facebook section, click Connect via Facebook. NOTE: If both blue buttons in the Authorization Required dialog already read "Connected," it means that you have already provided an Instagram via Facebook authorization. If you have login credentials for a different Facebook profile than you used to authorize for Instagram, you can also contribute a Facebook-Only authorization. Skip to Authorizing for Facebook through Email for instructions. Log in to Facebook and follow the prompts. Remember to use a Facebook profile that has not already been used for authorization by another user in your NetBase company account. If the profile you are using contains Facebook fan pages, click the checkbox for the desired page(s) or click the Select All checkbox, and then click Next IMPORTANT: If you authorize with a Facebook profile containing at least one Facebook fan page, you are not required to reauthorize every 60 days. Although you can authorize with a Facebook profile containing no Facebook fan pages, you will be required to reauthorize every 60 days. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/2Authorizing_for_Facebook Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:31:08 GMT Powered by 2 Verify that all NetBase Business Page Insight options are enabled. NOTES: • NetBase Business Page Insights may not work properly if you turn off these actions. • Ensure Manage ads for ad accounts you have access to is checked to enable access to the page's paid posts. Click Done. If authorization is successful, NetBase displays the authorization dialog with a Current Authorization Status section. If you encounter issues, see Troubleshooting Facebook Authorization and Data Issues. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/2Authorizing_for_Facebook Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:31:08 GMT Powered by 3
Collecting Facebook Paid Posts This article provides instructions for collecting and analyzing Facebook paid posts, which are targeted ads only visible on the news feed for a specified audience. Paid posts are intended to drive business to your website, generate leads, or otherwise promote your brand or Facebook page. Facebook Paid Posts To analyze Facebook Paid Posts, check the following requirements: • At least one user in your NetBase account must have the Advertiser role or above on the Facebook page with the paid posts you want to analyze. For more information on managing page roles, visit the Facebook Help Center. • The Facebook page must include at least one paid post. NOTE: A Facebook paid post (ad) is different from a Boosted post. Visit the Facebook Business Help Center for information about The Difference Between Boosted Posts and Facebook Ads. • You must have a valid Facebook authorization with Business Page Insights, including all relevant permissions, on the Facebook page containing the paid posts you want to analyze. See Authorizing for Facebook for details and instructions. Adding Facebook Paid Posts to a Topic Locate the Facebook Page and Paid Post IDs Before adding a paid post to your NetBase topic, obtain the full Facebook post URL, which includes the Facebook page ID and the Facebook paid post ID. To get the Facebook post URL go directly to the paid post on Facebook: 1. Right-click the paid post’s time stamp link and select Open in New Tab. 2. Copy the portion of the URL after facebook.com. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Collecting_Facebook_Paid_Posts Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:27:23 GMT Powered by 1 See Finding a Facebook page ID for additional information on finding the page ID for a page you own, administrate, or on which you have a page role. Add the Post ID to the Topic Posts Section 1. Scroll to the Posts section on the topic’s Definition tab. 2. In the Facebook Paid Posts filter, paste in the paid post URL and press Enter. After adding the paid post ID, NetBase displays a bar icon representing the Facebook page’s coverage. • Three bars indicate the Facebook page is valid and returns Followers/Impressions/Likes/Comments counts, comment text, paid posts, and paid post comments. • Two bars indicate the Facebook page is valid and returns Followers/Impressions/Likes/Comments counts and comment text but does not return paid posts or paid post comments. If the Facebook page is invalid, NetBase displays an error: https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Collecting_Facebook_Paid_Posts Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:27:23 GMT Powered by 2 2. Save the topic. • When adding paid posts to your topic, NetBase recommends setting the topic’s Language filter to All Languages. This ensures that NetBase retrieves paid posts and comments authored in any supported language. • If you encounter an error when adding a paid post URL that contains the Facebook page name, use the Facebook page ID in the URL instead. For example, add the paid post using “https://www.facebook.com/22092443056/posts/10159657934338057” instead of ““https://www.facebook.com/Starbucks/posts/10159657934338057.” After saving the topic, NetBase automatically adds the paid post’s corresponding Facebook page to the Channel Manager if it has not previously been added. What's Next You can analyze a NetBase topic that includes Facebook paid posts to review engagement metrics and comments using the Organic/Paid Post Types filter. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Collecting_Facebook_Paid_Posts Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:27:23 GMT Powered by 3

Facebook Data Collection This article provides information on how NetBase topics match Facebook data through keywords, channels, and image content. For information on downloading Facebook data to your NetBase company account, see Intro to Facebook Data Access. Facebook Data Collection Methods You can use one or all of the methods below in a social web topic to retrieve Facebook data for analysis. Your NetBase company account must have sufficient authorizations to download data from the number of Facebook channels that you have set up. See Authorization Calculator for instructions on determining the optimum number of authorizations you need for your account. Keyword Matching Keywords in a social web topic automatically match Facebook posts and comments downloaded to your company's single-client data pool as a result of channel-matching (see the following section). Keyword-matching does not download data from Facebook—to download data, you must add channels to your company topics. See Channel Matching below. For instructions on adding keywords to topics, see Defining Brand and Competitor Topics. Maximum history: Backfill or accumulate up to 27 months from the start of the topic's date range. NOTE: If your account has subscribed to the premium 51 months of history, you can backfill or accumulate up to 51 months of Facebook data; however, this requires that your NetBase company account has sufficient authorizations to download the volume of historical content. Due to Facebook API limitations, NetBase does not guarantee the download of every matching post, especially in backfills of data older than one year. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Facebook_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:32:36 GMT Powered by 1 Data available for analysis: Retrieves the following from your company's single-client data pool for analysis: • Posts • Comments • Comment, Like, and Share counts for the above posts NOTE: NetBase matches each post and comment individually; for example, a comment can match a topic's keywords even if its original post does not. Channel Matching Facebook pages specified in a social web topic download all posts from the Facebook page to your company's singleclient data pool (channel-matching downloads all posts published across the topic's date range, whether or not they match keywords or values in other sections of a topic's Definition tab). Once downloaded, channel data is available for matching by all of your company's topics and NetBase Pro/Instant Search searches. IMPORTANT: To ensure that a given topic has access to all posts from a particular channel, you must specify the channel in that topic's Channels section even if it has already been specified in another topic and NetBase has downloaded the channel data. For instructions on adding Facebook channels to a topic, see Defining Channel-Based Topics. Maximum history: Backfill or accumulate up to 27 months of history. NOTE: If your account has subscribed to the premium 51 months of history, you can backfill or accumulate up to 51 months of Facebook data; however, this requires that your NetBase company account has sufficient authorizations to download the volume of historical content. Due to Facebook API limitations, NetBase does not guarantee the download of every matching post, especially in backfills of data older than one year. Estimated channel download time: 30 days of history: Within one day on average, depending on the data volume. 27 months of history: It takes at least one day before fan page data starts to appear in the NetBase application and up to four days to completely download 27 months of history for an averaged-sized page (a page with two-three posts per day with fewer than 50 comments on each post). The download time might be shorter or longer depending on data volume. Data Downloads the following from the specified Facebook page: https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Facebook_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:32:36 GMT Powered by 2 available for analysis: • Brand posts and comments (those authored by the Facebook page administrator) including the post text, the post author’s name, the creation date, and other information. • The Facebook page's @username; NetBase analyzes the @username to identify geolocation data that may not otherwise be available directly from the Facebook page. NetBase applies this geolocation data to the page’s posts and any post comments, allowing you to use geo-specific analysis tools, like the Include Geographies filter or the Geo Regions widget, to filter or analyze Facebook data. • Visitor posts and comments (those authored by any user other than the Facebook page administrator) including the post text, creation date, and other information. NOTE: Visitor posts and comments published after February 2018 do not include the author's name. NOTES: • The Facebook API does not return Facebook live video posts from fan page timelines. • Data availability is subject to what the Facebook API returns. For example, the Facebook Graph API does not always return all posts for a fan page. • NetBase analyzes text in a Facebook page @username to determine geolocation and does not obtain geolocation from Facebook directly. Available engagement metrics: • Comment, Like, and Share counts on original posts and comments. NetBase counts a Comment as a post. • Followers/Visitors, which are Facebook Page Fan counts (Page Likes) NOTES: • Currently, NetBase does not track Reactions because Facebook does not provide an efficient way to obtain the reactions count for every post. Studies show, however, that Reactions currently represent only 3%1 of post engagements and do not significantly impact engagement metrics. • Unlike Twitter, Facebook does not process Reposts as documents. Reposts are included in the Facebook Shares metric count. • Mention count calculation for Facebook Comments: ? For a channel-only topic, NetBase counts every Comment sentence as a mention. ? For a channel-only topic with a filter, NetBase counts every Comment sentence that matches the filter as a mention. ? For a primary term topic, NetBase counts every Comment sentence that matches a primary term as a mention. ? For a primary term topic with a filter, NetBase counts every Comment sentence that matches both a primary term and the filter as a mention. Engagement metric update • Comments, Likes and Shares: For new posts, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Facebook_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:32:36 GMT Powered by 3 frequency: and 96 hours after a post is published. For posts older than 96 hours, only once. Tracking older engagements typically does not impact engagement metrics—studies show that 75%1 of all engagement on posts occurs within five hours of the post's publish time. • Followers/Visitors, which are Fan Page Count (Likes): Once daily NOTE: Because NetBase does not capture comments, Likes, or Shares published long after a post goes live, engagement metrics in the NetBase application might differ slightly from Facebook's engagement metrics. Image Content Matching (Premium) Image content in a social web topic's Logos filter and/or Image Terms filter matches Facebook data from your company's single-client data pool, which contains data downloaded from Facebook channels specified on the Definition tab of your company's topics. NOTE: Image Content is a premium feature. Contact your NetBase representative for a demo and pricing. For instructions on adding a logo and image text, see Defining Image-Based Topics. For detailed information on how NetBase processes logos, see Image Analysis FAQ. Maximum history: Backfill or accumulate up to 27 months from the start of the topic's date range NOTE: If your account has subscribed to the premium 51 months of history, you can backfill or accumulate up to 51 months of Facebook data; however, this requires that your NetBase company account has sufficient authorizations to download the volume of historical content. Due to Facebook API limitations, NetBase does not guarantee the download of every matching post, especially in backfills of data older than one year. Data matched: Known logos and image text in Facebook posts and comments downloaded through channel-matching (see above) Data available for analysis: Retrieves the following from your company's single-client data pool: • Posts and Comments downloaded to your company's single-client data pool through channelmatching (see section above). NetBase returns only matching posts and Comments that were published after NetBase was trained on the known logp. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Facebook_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:32:36 GMT Powered by 4 • Comment, Like, and Share counts on the above posts NOTE: NetBase matches each post and comment individually; for example, a comment can match a topic's logo even if its original post does not. Paid Posts Collecting Facebook paid posts, which are targeted ads only visible on the news feed for a specified audience, requires specific provisioning in NetBase and on the relevant Facebook page.

Renewing Facebook Authorization This article explains how to renew your Facebook authorization, which is required by Facebook every 60 days for security purposes. NOTE: Reauthorization is only required for authorizations through Facebook profiles containing no fan pages. If you provide a Facebook-Only authorization through a profile containing at least one Facebook fan page, your authorization never expires. Renewing Facebook Authorization In addition to authorization renewal reminder emails, NetBase alerts customers about expiring Facebook authorization upon login. Beginning two weeks before the expiration date, the Social Authorization dialog displays a warning message with the upcoming expiration date and prompts users to renew their authorization. Renewing an existing authorization (by clicking the Renew now link in a reminder email or at the top of the Authorization Required dialog) extends your existing authorization and keeps it connected to the same Facebook account (and its linked Instagram Business Profiles). This ensures that your account continues to maintain the required number of authorized Profiles to support the number of #hashtags and channels you want to track and that NetBase can continue to download comments from any owned profiles. Allowing your authorization to expire may lead to a gap in Facebook and Instagram content. Renewing your authorization before it expires prevents a gap in collection. If authorization expires, the buttons in the Authorization Required dialog change to Connect, and the only option is to reconnect If you encounter problems when attempting to renew your authorization, see instructions in Troubleshooting Facebook Authorization and Data Issues. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Renewing_Facebook_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:35:11 GMT Powered by 1

Troubleshooting Facebook Authorization and Data Issues This article provides tips for resolving issues that may occur during Facebook-Only authorization or data downloading. For instructions on authorizing for Facebook, see Authorizing for Facebook. For more information on how keywords, channels, and other topic filters match Facebook data, see How Topics Match Facebook Data. Authorization Issues Facebook Connect Button Reads "Connected" If you have already used the Social Authorization dialog (access by clicking your user name at the top right of the NetBase screen and clicking Social Authorization) to authorize for either Instagram via Facebook (which provides an Instagram authorization and a backup Facebook authorization) or Facebook-Only, the button in the Facebook section reads Connected. You can only use this dialog once to authorize; however, you can contribute another authorization through a different Facebook account by inviting yourself to authorize through the Authorization Manager. See the following section for instructions. Failed Authorization Renewal If your authorization renewal is not successful, the Authorization Required dialog displays an error. Using a different Facebook account to renew your authorization is the most common reason the authorization renewal fails. You must renew with the same Facebook account you originally used to authorize. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Troubleshooting_Facebook_Au… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:36:24 GMT Powered by 1 Data Downloading Issues Topics Not Returning Channel Data If you added a Facebook channel to a topic's Definition tab but the topic is not returning data from the channel, investigate these possible causes. • After you add a Facebook channel and save the topic, it typically takes at least one day for the Facebook fan page data to begin appearing in the NetBase platform. It can take up to three days to backfill all of the available historical data. For more information, see How Topics Match Facebook Data. • Your company account must have enough Facebook-Only authorizations to support the number of Facebook channels specified in your company's topics. If you do not have 1 Facebook-Only authorization for every 200 channels shown in the Channel Manager, downloads of Facebook data to your single-client data pool can slow and you will eventually miss posts. Use the Authorization Calculator to estimate the minimum and optimum number of authorizations you need and troubleshoot authorizations by exporting data from the Channel Manager. The Channel Status is Up-To-Date But Comments Are Missing In the Channel Manager, statuses apply only to channel posts and not comments. NetBase does not consider comments when determining status because it stops checking for comments at a fixed time period (96 hours after posting for Facebook and Instagram channels). Additionally, comment volume for popular pages is typically too high to retrieve 100% of comments. Missing Facebook Posts There are several possible reasons that a Facebook post containing matching keywords might not match a topic: • NetBase is still downloading the Facebook fan page and might not have downloaded the post yet. • Facebook did not return the post for one of the following reasons: ? The Facebook Graph API does not return all community-authored posts and not all comments for every post. ? The Facebook Graph API does not return text from embedded or linked articles. For example, Facebook https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Troubleshooting_Facebook_Au… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:36:24 GMT Powered by 2 returns only the text circled at the top of the post below: Differences Between Facebook Metrics in NetBase and the Facebook Application Facebook (the application) often returns values that differ from the values returned by the Facebook API for the same metric, although these inconsistencies disappear within a few minutes or hours. Metric data in NetBase is based on data provided by the Facebook API. Facebook (the application) sometimes returns a non-zero value for the number of post comments and likes when the Facebook API returns 0 (or a different value) for the same metric. In a few cases, these inconsistencies remain indefinitely. Facebook Page Download Limits Note the following limitations: • Download of 100% of posts not guaranteed. Due to Facebook API limitations, NetBase (like all third-party Facebook developers) cannot guarantee that all posts will be downloaded from a Facebook page. • Comment download limit. The Graph API permits an application to download a maximum of 2,500 comments, in chronological order, for one post. NetBase downloads comments for only 96 hours after a post’s publication (this applies only to posts published after the fan page was downloaded to the NetBase index); post comments published to Facebook after 96 hours are not available in NetBase and are not included in the comment count. Note that most post engagement occurs within the first few hours after an author has published the post. • Author download limit. NetBase cannot download the list of authors who shared a post. These limitations mean that: • When analyzing comment text (for example, to extract terms, sentiment, passion, emotions, behaviors, and attributes) NetBase can use only the first 2,500 comments. • When extracting authors and gender, NetBase can use only the first 2,500 comments and no shares. • Also add inconsistent metric values returned by Facebook API and NetBase application Facebook Data Download Interruptions Several events can interrupt NetBase’s download of Facebook fan page data. The table below explains what NetBase https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Troubleshooting_Facebook_Au… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:36:24 GMT Powered by 3 does under each condition. For some download interruptions, NetBase notifies you to take an action before it resumes downloading. Event Mitigation A Facebook server error NetBase retries the download every 60 seconds until Facebook resolves the problem. An unknown Facebook error NetBase tries two additional times to download the data. If unsuccessful on the third try, it does one of the following depending on when the unknown error occurred: • If the error occurred during comment or like retrieval, NetBase skips the current group of comments or likes and proceeds to the next group. • If the error occurred during post retrieval, NetBase continues to retry the download. A Facebook page name change NetBase disables the old page name and sends you an alert email. You must then open the Facebook page topic in NetBase and replace the old name with the new name specified in the email. Facebook authentication failure If your Facebook authorization becomes invalid, NetBase terminates the download and sends you an email asking you to reauthorize. This can occur because your authorization expired, Facebook page permissions changed, you changed your password, or Facebook made a security change. NOTE: Seven days before your Facebook authorization expires, NetBase sends you an email to prompt you to reauthorize. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/Troubleshooting_Facebook_Au… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:36:24 GMT Powered by 4

Managing Facebook Authorizations for Your Company Account This article describes how to manage Facebook-Only authorizations for your company account. Before You Start Ensure that all of the channels you want to track in your company account are listed in the Channel Manager. To specify channels, you can do either of the following: • Upload them to the Channel Manager via an import file. • Specify them in the Facebook Channels filter of a topic in your company account. Calculating Required Authorizations Follow the steps below to calculate the number of Facebook-Only authorizations needed to download the number of channels your company account is tracking. Open the Channel Manager by clicking your name at the top right of the screen, clicking Admin, and then clicking the Channels tab. Check the number of Facebook channels your company account is currently tracking under Downloading Facebook Channels at the top right of the page. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Facebook_Data_Guide/3Managing_Facebook_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:38:42 GMT Powered by 1 Click the Authorizations tab.

Intro to Instagram Data Access
This article provides an introduction to Instagram data downloading, the user authorizations required to download data,
how NetBase stores Instagram data, and an overview of the steps for downloading Instagram data for access by your
NetBase company account.
What is an Authorization?
Individual users in your NetBase company account contribute authorizations to support the download of Instagram data
for access by all account users. To authorize for Instagram, a user clicks a button in the NetBase application and logs in
to a Facebook account that contains a Facebook page linked to an Instagram Business or Creator Profile. Authorization
can also occur through a link in an email sent through the Authorization Manager.
See Authorizing for Instagram for detailed instructions on submitting an authorization.
The Importance of Authorizations
Instagram and Facebook require authorization from end users as industry-standard practice for providing all
social media analytics vendors, including NetBase, temporary and secure access to public data through the Instagram
and Facebook APIs. More specifically:
• If your NetBase company account has no Instagram authorizations, you cannot download and analyze
Instagram data.

• If you do not have enough authorizations for the volume of data your system is set up to download or authorizations
are not correctly distributed across owned channels, Instagram flowing into your NetBase company account
may slow or stop completely. If a gap occurs in Instagram channel data, you can backfill the missing data;
however, because Instagram only permits vendors to download the last 24 hours of data for each tracked #hashtag,
you cannot restore Instagram #hashtag-matched data if it stops flowing for more than 24 hours. The analysis shown
below is a real scenario where a company account's authorizations lapsed for a period of five days. This occurred
because the authorizations were deleted in the Authorization Manager, or were revoked in Facebook. With no
authorizations, NetBase could not download any Instagram data into the company's single-client data pool. The
company account could restore the channel-matched data, but experienced a permanent 5-day gap in #hashtagmatched Instagram data.
• To download some types of data, such as comment text and #hashtag-matched posts, authorizing users must have
a specific permission on an Instagram account’s linked Facebook page.
See the following articles for detailed instructions on setting up authorizations for your NetBase company account:
• If your NetBase company account already has some authorizations, see Optimizing Instagram Authorizations
(Existing Accounts) for information on determining whether you have a sufficient number.
• If you are a new NetBase company account and need help calculating authorizations, adding channels, and
assigning #hashtags, see Setting Up Instagram Authorizations (New Accounts).
Authorization Types
NetBase supports two types of authorizations—Instagram via Facebook and Facebook-Only. Because Instagram is a
subsidiary of Facebook, Instagram and Facebook authorizations are interrelated:
• An Instagram via Facebook user authorization supports downloading Instagram data into your company's singleclient data pool. When no Instagram data is being downloaded, NetBase uses this authorization type to download
Facebook data.
• A Facebook-Only user authorization exclusively supports downloading Facebook data into your company's singleclient data pool.
Because Instagram via Facebook authorizations primarily support downloading Instagram data, NetBase recommends
that if you are tracking both Instagram and Facebook channels that you obtain both types of authorization for your
NetBase company account. For information on Facebook-only authorizations, see Facebook Data Guide.

Unique Facebook Accounts
Each authorization that a user contributes to your NetBase company account must occur through a unique Facebook
account that has not already been used for authorization by another user in your NetBase company account. If a user
authorizes by logging in to an already used Facebook account, the authorization does not increase your NetBase
company account's capacity for downloading data. For example, if 3 users authorize using the same corporate
Facebook account, it counts as only 1 authorization.
Instagram Data Available for Downloading
NetBase can download public posts from public Instagram Business or Creator accounts. NetBase does not support
downloading data from Personal (non-professional) Instagram accounts. The sections below list the types of data
NetBase can download and the required permissions and authorizations for each.
NetBase downloads Instagram data from Business/Creator accounts into your single-client data pool exclusively for use
by registered users in your NetBase company account. Once in your single-client data pool, the data is available for
matching by keyword, channel, geo-fence, and image text by any topic in your company account as well as NetBase Pro
searches. For details on the maximum history, data available for analysis, and other information, see Instagram Data
Collection.
Basic Channel Coverage
Basic channel coverage allows you to download data from any public Instagram Business or Creator account. These are
channels for which you have no access credentials, such as your competitors’ Instagram channels. For example,
Starbucks could download posts from the Peet’s, Dunkin Donuts, and other (up to 1,000 public Instagram channels) with
a single authorization.

Minimum
Authorizations:
At least 1 Instagram via Facebook authorization for every 1,000 channels listed in the Channel

Permissions
Required:
No permissions required on the tracked channels (users providing authorizations to support basic
coverage must have required credentials on the Instagram account used to authorize)
Extended Channel Coverage
Extended channel coverage allows you to download additional data from your owned Instagram Business or Creator
accounts—those for which you have login credentials and sufficient permissions on their linked Facebook page to
access the data you want. In addition:
• Users must authorize on the specific Instagram accounts from which you want the extended data.
• You may need 4-6 or more authorizations on the same owned channel depending on comment, @mention media
tag, and #hashtag volume. For example, if Starbucks wants to track a high-volume #hashtag like #starbucks,
multiple users in the Starbucks NetBase account would need to authorize through unique Facebook accounts
containing Facebook pages linked to the Starbucks Instagram channel.
Extended Channel
Coverage Type
Required Permission on
Linked Facebook Page* Minimum Authorizations
Comment text Analyst or above At least 1** on the specific owned channel from
which you want comments
Posts containing an
@mention tagged in media Moderator or above At least 1-2** (in addition to the above) on the
@mention channel
Posts containing a
#hashtag Analyst or above At least 1-2** (in addition to the above) on the
channel to which the #hashtag is assigned
*If your organization uses Facebook Business Manager to manage your Facebook pages, authorized users must be
assigned specific task-based permissions (instead of a page role as shown in the table above). See Facebook Business
Manager Permissions for details.
**The actual number of required authorizations depends on post volume. See Optimizing Instagram Authorizations

Linking a Facebook Page to an Instagram Account This article provides steps for verifying that an Instagram account is a Business/Creator account and linking it to a Facebook page. Verifying that an Instagram Profile is a Business/Creator Account The following methods can be used to verify if an Instagram Profile is a Business/Creator account. Method 1 The simplest method to verify that an Instagram profile is a Business/Creator account is by attempting to add the channel to a NetBase topic. NetBase displays the icon for Instagram profiles that are Non-Business profiles. Method 2 Check to see if a business category appears below the page name. For example, Starbucks lists their business category as a brand. A business category may not be present if an Instagram account does not specify their business category or selects to hide it. If an Instagram profile does not display a business category, go to method 3 below to verify that the Instagram profile is a Business/Creator account. Method 3 Verify that the Instagram profile has a contact or shop link/button (visible only in the Instagram app), as these are key indicators of Business/Creator accounts. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/2Linking_a_Facebook_Page_to… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:41:36 GMT Powered by 1 Connecting a Facebook Page to an Instagram Business/Creator Account • You can only link one Instagram Business/Creator account to one Facebook page.

Setting Up Instagram Authorizations (New Accounts) This article describes how to set up a new NetBase company account to download Instagram data and keep it flowing at an optimal rate, with no slowing or data gaps. For an introduction to authorizations, which are required by Facebook to download Instagram data into your company’s single-client data pool, see Intro to Instagram Data Access. Who Should Read this Article Follow these instructions if your organization is brand new to NetBase and you are setting up channels, authorizations, and #hashtags, from scratch. If you are an existing NetBase company and want to determine if you have sufficient authorizations for the Instagram data you want to track, see Optimizing Authorizations (Existing Accounts). Gathering Data Follow the steps below to gather data you will need to add channels and #hashtags and estimate and allocate authorizations for your NetBase company account. Make a list of all Instagram channels from which you want to download data. If you are familiar with creating a CSV file in Excel, add the channels to a CSV file for bulk uploading (click here for information on the CSV file format); if you do not want to create a CSV file, you can add channels to topics in your NetBase company account. Your channel list can include the following: • Non-owned channels for Basic Coverage (download posts with a limited amount of metadata on the posts). Non-owned means other businesses’ Instagram channels for which no one in your NetBase company account has login credentials. For example, if you are Starbucks and you add the Peet’s Instagram channel, it is a non-owned channel and you can only get Basic coverage on it. • Owned channels for Extended Coverage (comments, @mentions tagged in media, and #hashtags). Owned means Instagram channels that a) one of your NetBase company account users has login credentials for and b) are linked to a Facebook page on which the user has the required permission for the data you want to download (the sections below provide additional detail). Make a note of the total number of owned channels. You can only track Instagram Business or Creator accounts. For information on how to determine whether an account is a Business/Creator account, see Linking a Facebook Page to an Instagram Account. For information on converting a personal account to a Business/Creator account, see Set Up a Business Account on Instagram. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 1 Make a list of all Instagram #hashtags for which you want to download matching data. Make a note of the total number of #hashtags. Adding Instagram Channels Use one of the following methods to add the Instagram channels from which you want data to NetBase. Uploading Channels in a CSV File Go to the Channel Manager, which lists all of the Instagram and Facebook channels you want to track. Import the CSV file that you created in the Gathering Data section above. Make a note of the total number of Instagram channels your company account is tracking, indicated below under Active Instagram Channels at the top center of the page. NOTE: NetBase cannot start downloading data for these channels (their Data Health value will remain Queued) unless or until users in your NetBase company account have submitted authorizations. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 2 Adding Channels to Topics Open a topic for editing in your NetBase account. Add channels to the Instagram Channels filter. You can add up to 80 channels per topic. Data from these channels will be available for matching by all topics in your NetBase account. After you add topics to channels, NetBase displays them in the Channel Manager. Calculating Required Authorizations Follow the steps below to estimate the minimum and optimum number of authorizations you need in your NetBase company account to download Instagram channel, comment, #hashtag, and @mention media-tagged data into your single-client data pool with optimal latency. Download and open the Authorization Calculator. Enter numbers into the three indicated cells below: • The total number of Instagram channels you added in the previous section. • The number of owned Instagram channels from the "Gathering Data" section above. • The number of #hashtags from the "Gathering Data" section above. The calculator automatically fills in the minimum and optimal number of authorizations for your company account. The minimum is the number needed to mitigate the risk of data gaps and drops. The optimal number is the number required to ensure that NetBase collects all content even when you are tracking high-volume #hashtags. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 3 Allocating Authorizations and Inviting Users to Authorize Use the Authorization Planning Matrix that appears below to determine how to allocate authorizations across owned and non-owned Instagram channels: • Allocate for basic coverage. A NetBase company account needs one authorization for every 1,000 channels listed in the Channel Manager. Since the company account in our example has 377 total channels, they need to set aside only 1 for basic coverage on all Instagram channels they are tracking. For this authorization, a user can authorize by logging into any unique Facebook account containing a Facebook page that is linked to any Instagram Business or Creator account. • Allocate for extended coverage. To access comment text, @mention media tags, and #hashtags on owned accounts, users need to authorize directly on the owned accounts and have specific permission on the linked Facebook pages. If the company account in our example wants to set up the minimum number of authorizations, they should allocate the remaining 14 authorizations across their owned channels. If all of the #hashtags you want to track are low- to medium-volume, distribute the #hashtags evenly across the channels. High-volume #hashtags require multiple authorizations on the same owned channel, as many as 4-6 or more. For example, if you are Starbucks and you want to download mentions of #starbucks (a high-volume #hashtag), multiple users would need to authorize through the Starbucks Instagram channel through a unique Facebook account that is linked to a Facebook page on which the user has the Moderator role or above. NOTE: If you do not have enough users in your NetBase company account to authorize for extended coverage, you can invite non-NetBase users to donate authorizations. For example, you could invite individuals from other teams in your company with credentials to access your owned channels. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 4 Follow the steps below to allocate the authorizations from the matrix across all channels for which you want basic coverage (both owned and non-owned channels) and those owned channels for which you want extended coverage—downloading comment text, @mentions matched in media tags, and assigning #hashtags. Send the following email to the users(s) you want to authorize for basic coverage. In the example, this is only one user. Email Template for Authorizing Users (Basic Coverage) Subject: Please Authorize for Instagram Hi, : This email is to notify you that you will be receiving an email from the NetBase system asking you to contribute an “Instagram via Facebook” authorization. Please follow the instructions below to authorize, which will increase our capacity to download Instagram data into our NetBase company account. Without your authorization, Instagram data flowing into our account may slow or stop completely. 1. Identify a Facebook account that has not already been used to authorize in our NetBase company account. You can use your personal Facebook account for this purpose—NetBase only uses personal accounts for authorization and never retrieves data from them or posts to your timeline. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 5 2.

Click Send Email Request. If, based on the results of the Authorization Calculator, you need to ask non-NetBase users to donate authorizations, click Invite Users to Authorize via Email. NOTE: Inviting a nonNetBase user to authorize does not create a NetBase user login. a. Enter the email address of a non-NetBase user or a NetBase user. b. Click Instagram via Facebook. c. Click Send Email Request. NOTE: If you want to track both Instagram and Facebook channels in your NetBase company account, you need at least 1 Facebook-Only authorization for every 200 Facebook pages you want to track. If you need all of the users in your NetBase company account for Instagram authorizations, you can follow the instructions in step 3 above to invite nonNetBase users to submit Facebook-Only authorizations. See Facebook Data Guide for details. Adding #Hashtags After users have authorized on your organization’s owned Instagram channels, they automatically appear in the Instagram #Hashtag Manager where you can assign #hashtags to them and start downloading the data. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 8 Open the Instagram #Hashtag Manager. Assign #hashtags to each authorized Business/Creator profile according to your Authorization Planning Matrix. Analyzing the Downloaded Data Assuming that your NetBase company account has sufficient authorizations for the data you want to download, NetBase will begin downloading Instagram data to your company’s single-client data pool. Do the following to ensure that your topics can access the downloaded data: To analyze all data downloaded from a channel, ensure that you specify the channel in the Instagram Channels filter of the topic you want to use to analyze the data. If you do not do this, the topic will only retrieve channel data that matches the topic’s keywords. To access data matching #hashtags assigned in the Instagram #Hashtag Manager and a channel’s @mention media-tagged posts, specify both the #hashtag and the @handle in the Primary Terms filter of the topic you want to use to analyze the data. Monitoring Instagram Data Downloads After you have completed all of the steps in the sections above, monitor the data flowing from Instagram into NetBase to make sure there is no slowing or gaps. • If you notice that posts and comments from your native Instagram channels or @mention media-tagged posts are not flowing into NetBase, it typically means that post volume requires that you add more authorizations to the channel. For instructions on optimizing authorizations for your NetBase company account after you complete the instructions in this article, see Optimizing Authorizations (Existing Accounts). https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Setting_Up_Instagram_Author… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:42:43 GMT Powered by 9 NOTE: If you are not seeing Instagram comments in NetBase, it may also be due to polling frequency—NetBase only polls for comments for 96 hours after an original post is published. • If you notice that #hashtag-matched posts do not seem to be appearing in NetBase, it can mean that the channel needs additional authorizations or that another issue has occurred with #hashtag processing. See Using the Instagram #Hashtag Manager for details. • Monitor the Authorization Manager to ensure that authorizations do not become invalid because they have expired or users revoked access.

Authorization Calculator This article provides a downloadable Excel spreadsheet that estimates the minimum and optimal number of authorizations your company account needs based on the number of owned channels, non-owned channels, and #hashtags you want to track. Download the Calculator The Authorization Calculator only estimates the minimum and optimal number of authorizations your company needs. You may need to add authorizations beyond the recommended number for large channels with high content volumes. Click here to open the calculator: Download the Calculator How to Use the Calculator Simply fill in the yellow boxes at the top right. The spreadsheet automatically returns the minimum and optimal number of authorizations for your company account. IMPORTANT: Users in your company account must authorize on the specific owned channels for which you want comment text, @mention media tag-matched posts, or to which you have assigned #hashtags in the #Hashtag Manager. Allocating the Recommended Number of Authorizations Across Channels This section explains how to allocate the estimated authorizations across channels in your company account. 1. Allocate 1 authorization for every 1,000 channels your company account is tracking for basic coverage. For basic coverage, it does not matter which Instagram channel a user authorizes on, as long as it is linked to a Facebook page within a unique Facebook account that the user has access to. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Authorization_Calculator Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:56:53 GMT Powered by 1 2. Next, allocate 1 authorization for each owned channel in your company account for which you want extended coverage—in our example, this is 5 of the 15 authorizations because the company account has 5 owned channels. Users must authorize on these specific channels with at least the Analyst page role or View Page Performance permission on the linked Facebook page. If you want to collect @mention media tag-matched posts, the user must have the Moderator page role or Moderate Messages and Comments permission. 3. Allocate the remaining authorizations—in our example, this is 4, for downloading #hashtag-matched data. Users must authorize on the specific Instagram channels to which the #hashtags are assigned in the #Hashtag Manager, with the authorizations distributed across the channels according to #hashtag volume. 4. Finally, consider adding more authorizations to owned channels with assigned high-volume #hashtags (more than 100,000 posts per day), @mention media tag-matched posts (more than 50,000 posts per day), or comment text (more than 100,000 posts per day). https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Authorization_Calculator Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:56:53 GMT Powered by 2

Remove authorizations with the status Duplicate, which indicates the underlying Facebook account has been used for authorization more than once and do not increase your capacity to download Instagram data. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 1 After all authorizations in the Authorization Manager have a Valid status, go to the Instagram #Hashtag Manager and click Export All Tracked #Hashtags in NetBase. In the export file, scroll to the bottom and make a note of the numbers shown for Total Business/Creator Accounts (your owned accounts) and Total Tracked #Hashtags in NetBase. Calculating Required Authorizations Follow the steps below to estimate the minimum and optimum number of authorizations you need in your NetBase company account to download Instagram channel, comment, #hashtag, and @mention media-tagged data into your single-client data pool with optimal latency. Download and open the Authorization Calculator. Enter numbers into the three indicated cells below: • The total number of Instagram channels shown in the Channel Manager. • The number of owned Instagram channels and #hashtags shown in the export file from the previous section. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 2 The calculator automatically fills in the minimum and optimal number of authorizations for your company account. The minimum is the number needed to mitigate the risk of data gaps and drops. The optimal number is the number required to ensure that NetBase collects all content even when you are tracking high-volume #hashtags. Allocating Authorizations Follow the steps below to allocate authorizations across all channels for which you want basic coverage (both owned and non-owned channels) and those owned channels for which you want extended coverage—downloading comment text, @mentions matched in media tags, and assigning #hashtags. Your company account needs 1 authorization for every 1,000 channels your company account is tracking for basic coverage. Since the company account in our example has 377 total channels, they need to set aside only 1 for basic coverage on all Instagram channels they are tracking. This leaves a minimum of 14 or a maximum of 74 authorizations, which must be allocated across your company account’s owned Instagram channels to ensure that NetBase can download #hashtags, comments, and @mention media tags with no slowing or gaps. In the Channel Manager, click Export and open the export file. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 3 Filter the export file to display only rows where the Domain is instagram.com and the Channel Role column is not blank. Scroll right to view values in columns M, N, and O, which show a channel’s authorized users, its data coverage, and the highest role that one of the authorized users has on the channel’s linked Facebook page. Review the following to identify the channels to which you will allocate the remaining authorizations from the calculator: • To download comment text from a channel, make sure it has at least 1 authorized user with the Analyst role or above. • To assign #hashtags to a channel, make sure it has at least 1-2 additional authorized users with the Analyst role or above. • To download posts with the channel’s @mentions in media tags, make sure it has at least 1-2 additional authorized users with the Moderator role or above. This means that if you want comment text, #hashtags, and @mention media tags for a channel, it should have at least 3 or more authorized users. The number of recommended users is based on average volume. For high-volume #hashtags, comments, and @mention media tags, a channel needs additional authorized users to download all of the data at an optimal rate with no slowing or gaps. Continue on to the next section to invite additional users to authorize on the channels that require more authorizations. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 4 Inviting Users to Authorize Identify individuals to authorize on the channels that require more authorizations and let them know the following: • They will be receiving a NetBase system-generated email invitation prompting them to contribute an Instagram via Facebook authorization. • They should click the link in the system-generated email and authorize through a unique Facebook account with a Facebook page linked to a specific Instagram channel. The Facebook account they use cannot already have been used to authorize for your NetBase company account. Users typically use their personal Facebook accounts for this purpose (NetBase does not retrieve any data from the Facebook account and does not post to the timeline). NetBase provides a template email, included below this section, that you can use to communicate with users about contributing an authorization. In the Authorization Manager, click Invite Users to Authorize via Email. Enter the email address of a non-NetBase user or a NetBase user (you can request Instagram via Facebook authorizations from NetBase users who are already authorized for FacebookOnly; however, they must use a different Facebook account) and select Instagram via Facebook. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 5 NOTE: Inviting a non-NetBase user to authorize does not create a NetBase user login. Click Send Email Request. Email Template for Authorizing Users Use the following template to communicate with users in advance to let them know they will be receiving an email asking them to authorize. Subject: Please Authorize on the Instagram Channel Hi, : This email is to notify you that you will be receiving an email from the NetBase system asking you to contribute an “Instagram via Facebook” authorization. Please follow the instructions below to authorize, which will increase our capacity to download Instagram data into our NetBase company account. Without your authorization, Instagram data flowing into our account may slow or stop completely. 1. Identify a Facebook account that has not already been used to authorize in our NetBase company account. Users can use their personal Facebook account for this purpose—NetBase only uses personal accounts for authorization and never retrieves data from them or posts to your timeline. 2. Ensure that the Facebook account contains a Facebook page on which you have the role. For instructions, see Adding a Facebook Page. 3. Ensure that the Facebook page is linked to this Instagram channel: https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 6 For instructions, Linking a Facebook Page to an Instagram Channel. 4. When you receive the email prompting you to authorize, simply click the link and log in to the Facebook account identified in step 1. If you have any questions about this process, please contact me. Monitoring Instagram Data Downloads After you have completed all of the steps in the sections above, monitor the data flowing from Instagram into NetBase to make sure there is no slowing or gaps. • If you notice that posts from your native Instagram channels are not flowing into NetBase, it typically means that post volume requires that you add more authorizations to the channel. NOTE: If you are not seeing Instagram comments in NetBase, it may also be due to polling frequency—NetBase only polls for comments for 96 hours after an original post is published. • If you notice that #hashtag-matched posts do not seem to be appearing in NetBase, it can mean that the channel needs additional authorizations or that another issue has occurred with #hashtag processing. See Using the Instagram #Hashtag Manager for details. • Monitor the Authorization Manager to ensure that authorizations do not become invalid because they have expired or users revoked access. For additional help on determining why data may not be downloading into your NetBase company account at the optimal rate, see Troubleshooting Instagram Data and Authorizations. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Optimizing_Instagram_Authoriz… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 03:58:25 GMT Powered by 7
Using the Reset Authorization Manually Option This article explains when to use the Reset Authorization Manually option in the Social Authorization dialog. Reenabling Automatic Authorization During authorization, if you select all Instagram Business Accounts, all Facebook pages, and leave all permissions set to Yes in the dialogs shown below, NetBase automatically authorizes any additional Instagram Business/Creator accounts (with linked Facebook pages) that are added to the Facebook account you used for authorization (assuming you have permission on the added accounts). However, if you deselect any Instagram accounts or Facebook pages or set permissions to No when you authorize, NetBase cannot automatically include subsequently added accounts to your authorization. If you then receive permissions on additional Instagram accounts under the authorized Facebook account, you must open the Social Authorization dialog and click Reset Authorization Manually as indicated below to reset authorization. Resetting an authorization (by clicking the Reset Authorization Manually link) revokes your existing authorization and replaces it with a new one. If you do not complete all the steps to reauthorize during the reset or you authorize using a different Facebook account with different linked Instagram accounts than the previous authorization, however, data may stop flowing into your account and result in a data loss. You should only reset an authorization if you disabled automatic authorization when authorizing previously by deselecting any of the Instagram accounts linked to the Facebook account. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Using_the_Reset_Authorization… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 04:00:36 GMT Powered by 1 Resetting authorization restores automatic authorization and includes any additional Instagram accounts linked to the Facebook account for which you have received permission. If you do not complete authorization or if authorization fails, you will no longer be authorized and Instagram data flowing into your account may be disrupted. After you click the link to reset authorization, NetBase displays a side panel that prompts you to click Proceed to confirm the reset. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/Using_the_Reset_Authorization… Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 04:00:36 GMT Powered by 2
Authorizing for Instagram This article provides steps for individual NetBase users to authorize for Instagram. For an introduction to this process, see Intro to Instagram Data Access. For instructions on managing Instagram authorizations across your NetBase company account, see one of the following: Optimizing Instagram Authorizations (Existing Accounts) Setting Up Instagram Authorizations (New Accounts) Before You Authorize Before you can authorize for Instagram in the NetBase application, ensure that you have the proper Facebook/ Instagram setup outside of NetBase. Login credentials to a Facebook account that has not already been used for authorization in NetBase. Users typically use their personal Facebook accounts for this purpose (NetBase does not retrieve any data from the Facebook account and does not post to the timeline). The Facebook account must contain a Facebook page on which you have the Analyst role or above (to download Instagram comments and #hashtags into your NetBase company account) or the Moderator role or above (to also download @mention media-tagged posts). See Facebook Business Manager Permissions if your organization uses the Facebook Business Manager to administer your Facebook channels. You can connect the Facebook account to one of your organization’s corporate Facebook pages (if you do not have access, contact the individuals who manage the pages and request access with a specified role) or you can add a Facebook Page. NOTE: Authorizing through a Facebook profile with at least one fan page means you are not required to reauthorize every 60 days. The Facebook page must be linked to an Instagram Business or Creator account. Contact your NetBase administrator to determine if you should link the Facebook page to a specific Instagram channel. For instructions, see Linking a Facebook Page to an Instagram Channel. For instructions on converting a non-business Instagram account to a Business or Creator account, click here. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/2Authorizing_for_Instagram Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 04:02:04 GMT Powered by 1 How to Authorize You can authorize for Instagram in the NetBase application or through a link in an email sent by the NetBase system.

Although Instagram discontinued geolocation metadata in December 2018, NetBase’s next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) can determine the country of origin for 38% of English Instagram posts (including channel-, @mention-, and #hashtag-matched) with 92% accuracy. NetBase currently provides this support for English Instagram posts originating from one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, or the United States. AI-assigned geolocation data for Instagram posts will be available from November 4, 2020 forward. The Include/Exclude Geographies filters, when set to one or more of the supported English-speaking countries, can now match Instagram data in NetBase topics and analyses. Previously, this filter displayed no results for Instagram data. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Instagram_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 04:03:14 GMT Powered by 8 How NetBase Identifies Instagram Post Geolocation NetBase uses proprietary, next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to determine an Instagram post’s location. First, AI identifies geolocation indicators in an Instagram post, such as text, #hashtags, speech patterns, spelling, emoji characteristics, links, author handles, and currency symbols. Next, AI calculates the weighted importance of these features and their combinations to accurately determine the post’s location. In the example below, NetBase assigned the Instagram post a location of United Kingdom. Geographically relevant indicators, such as the British standard spelling of “favourite,” heart emoji characteristics, and the currency symbol all contribute to the designation. AI-assigned geolocation data for some Instagram posts results in the following increases across the entire NetBase index: • A 38% increase in geolocation coverage for English-authored Instagram posts (up from 0%). • A 7% increase in geolocation coverage for all English posts. The increase of geo-tagged Instagram data in your company’s NetBase account depends on whether the topics and analyses filter to the relevant geographies, languages, and countries and how much of that matching data is from Instagram. • NetBase artificial intelligence assigns geolocation data to the Instagram source type only. Location metadata for other source types, such as Twitter or other domains, remains unchanged. In the example above, the sound bite from Twitter displays a location of “Hertfordshire,” which NetBase derives through the Twitter API. https://nbq360.netbasequid.com/Enterprise/Analyst/Data_Reference/3Instagram_Data_Guide/3Instagram_Data_Collection Updated: Sun, 12 Mar 2023 04:03:14 GMT Powered by 9 • Support for additional languages may be available in a future release. Geo-fence Matching (Premium) A geo-fence in a social web topic's Geo-fence filter matches GPS-tagged Instagram posts and comments in your company's single-client data pool that were published within the circumscribed geographic area on or before April 4, 2018 only. Geo-fences do not retrieve Instagram data after April 4, 2018. For instructions on adding a geo-fence to a topic, see Defining Geo-Fence-Based Topics. NOTE: Using a geo-fence in a topic is a premium feature. Contact your NetBase representative for a demo and pricing. Image Content Matching (Premium) Image content in a social web topic's Logos filter and/or Image Terms filter retrieves the following matching Instagram data from your company's single-client data pool: • Posts published on or before December 11, 2018 • Posts published on or after March 13, 2019 NOTE: If your account has subscribed to the premium 51 months of history, you can backfill or accumulate up to 51 months of image content-matched data; however, this only includes data published after NetBase was trained on the logo.

Facebook Business Manager Permissions This article explains the permissions you must assign to users in the Facebook Business Manager so that NetBase can use their authorization for downloading comment text, #hashtag-matched posts, and @mention media tag-matched posts. Facebook Business Manager Permissions for Extended Instagram Coverage When Facebook Business Manager is used to manage the Facebook Business page(s) you are attempting to authorize, permissions must be assigned to users to control what they can do on the page via their Business Role (Employee or Admin).
